The Purpose of this Assignment was to come up with a basic text based game written in python, the MileStone file was an early version of the full game and the TextBasedGamed file is the semi completed version.
we were required to come up with a theme of our choice(mine being alien abduction) and how our player character be able to navigate between rooms and collect items and add them to thier inventory.
the player wins when all items are collected and exits the map using one of the rooms in their layout.
although not part of the assignment i was planning on adding a boss for the final room to aquire the last item, although not completing i plan of finishing it later for fun.
